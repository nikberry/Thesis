\begin{abstract}

We present the top-quark pair plus photon production cross section measured in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, using data recorded in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of Lint = 19.6 fb − 1 . The measurement is performed in the dilepton decay channel. The signal region is defined by the final state of the process pp → W + W − b bγ,
with a minimum photon transverse energy of E$_\text{T}(\gamma) > 20$ GeV and minimum distance of $\Delta R(\gamma, b/\bar{b}) > 0.1$ between the photon and the b-quark in $\eta - \phi$ space. Signal events are simulated using the WHIZARD event generator. The normalized cross-
section, $R=\frac{\sigma_{t\bar{t}+\gamma}}{\sigma_{t\bar{t}}}$, is exploited in order to cancel various sources of systematic uncertainties. the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty of 17.3 arises due to the modelling of the $t\bar{t}$ background process. We measure the fiducial normalised cross-section, requiring E$_T(\gamma) > 25$ GeV and $\abs{\eta(\gamma)} < 1.4442$ on the final state photon, to be $R^{fid.} = ( 0.72 \pm 0.04(stat.) \pm 0.15(syst.) ) \times 10^2$. Extrapolated into the signal region, we obtain $R = ( 0.89 \pm 0.05(stat.) \pm 0.18(syst.) ) \times 10^2$. Using a recent CMS $t\bar{t}$ cross-section measurement at 8 TeV, we calculate the top pair plus photon production cross-section to be $\sigma_{t\bar{t}+\gamma}^{CMS} = 2.0 \pm 0.1(stat.) \pm 0.4(syst.)$. Being in agreement with the $t\bar{t}+\gamma$ SM expectation of $\sigma_{t\bar{t}+\gamma}^{SM} = 1.8 \pm 0.5$ pb, this is the most accurate measurement of the $t\bar{t}+\gamma$ process to date, and the first at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV.
